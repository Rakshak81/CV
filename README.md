## Rakshak Shetty

I am a highly analytical software developer and a graduate of Makers Academy, a highly selective Software Development bootcamp. I have a background in Banking and having worked as an Outcome Tester, I have been able to develop and demonstrate my communication and attention to detail. I have a passion for problem solving and I am an avid puzzle solver, so what really excites me about a career in tech is the opportunity to use my problem solving skills and to work in an industry that constantly evolves and innovates.

## Skills

#### Team worker

During my time at Makers Academy, we often worked in teams of 4 to 6. Good communication was one of the key aspects of working together. I love giving and receiving feedback, helping both my team members and me to grow as better programmers. Another important aspect is time management, I like breaking the tasks into achievable pieces based on priorities and approaching them in the Agile way.


#### Problem-Solver/Attention to Detail

My experience of working as a Outcome Tester enabled me to gain a keen eye on finding/fixing bugs.I have got a passion for problem solving and I am avid puzzle solver and enjoy a challenge.

#### Self-Motivated

Makers Academy is a 16 week intensive coding bootcamp which has a large focus on self-directed learning. This made me an ideal candidate as I enjoy getting stuck into learning new skills. I began completing a number of online courses, workbooks and spending most of my free time studying code. This attitude has helped me to manage the various tasks and challenges of the course.
